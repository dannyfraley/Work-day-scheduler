# Work-day-scheduler
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

When the user opens the planner, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.
The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, 9am - 5pm.
When the user views the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When the user clicks into a timeblock, they can enter an event.
When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When the user clicks the delete button for that timeblock, the text for that event is cleared from the timeblock.
When the user refreshes the page, the saved events persist.
